## The Problem that people face
* let us imagine, A beginner developer made a website or an app or a game , The first thing they want to know after completing is , have they done it well or could’ve done better and they try to improvise it and for that they need a constructive feedback and to get a feedback they need to promote their project and expose it to many people.
*  They can place it in play store (if it’s an app) ,but who downloads an underdeveloped app( what else can we expect from a beginner) and they can also show their project to their friends then the only people who review are their friends and well that’s not sufficient to improve ourselves.

## Proposed solution 
* Our Website IMDevB allows user to create a profile and user can upload his project in our website where user can get upvotes and comments on their project which were given by remaining users 
* We are not expecting elite developers to come and review ( cause why will a good developer enter in to our site and review some basic projects or maybe they will but we’re not counting on that)
* Our website is a place where beginner developers share their projects , help each other and try to improve themselves ,also reviewing various projects will give a sense of direction to the beginners on what to work on next ( Apes together strong )
